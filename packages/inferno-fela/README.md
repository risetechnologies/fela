Official [Inferno](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno) bindings for Fela.

<img alt="npm downloads" src="https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/inferno-fela.svg">
<img alt="gzipped size" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/gzipped-2.35kb-brightgreen.svg">

This package only includes Inferno bindings for [Fela](http://github.com/rofrischmann/fela).<br>
It assumes you already know about Fela and how to use it.

## Installation
```sh
npm i --save inferno-fela
```
Assuming you are using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) as your package manager you can just `npm install`.<br>
Otherwise we also provide a [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd). You can easily use it via [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/). It registers a  `InfernoFela` global.
> **Caution**: You need to include both Inferno and Fela on your own as well.

## API

## Usage
For more information and best practices on how to effectively use this package, please check out the main [Fela Documention - Usage with Inferno](http://fela.js.org/docs/guides/UsageWithInferno.html). There you will also find some usage examples. This package only contains the pure API reference documentation.
